# Building Controls Frontend

This is a frontend application for managing building controls, implemented using React.js.

## Overview

The application allows users to view detailed statuses of a building and its rooms, set the requested temperature of the building, and perform CRUD operations on rooms (add, remove, edit). It interacts with the backend through an API to fetch building data and update building details.

## Features

- Display building details including requested temperature
- Display room details including temperature and heating/cooling status
- Set requested temperature of the building
- Add, remove, and edit rooms in the building

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies:

4. Start the development server:

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Assumptions

- I assumed that the backend API is already implemented and provides endpoints for fetching building data and performing CRUD operations on rooms.
